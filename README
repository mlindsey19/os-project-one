this is the first project for cs4760 sp-2019

this program read a file with some integers formatted similarly to this:
3
6
3 6 107 8 1 3
4
1 3 50 4
7
5 3 5 7 8 9 1

it creates a child process to read each line and write it to file in reverse


this project is not late for lack of trying. I spent a good amount of time working on other projects
namley learning pascal. I also spent too much time setting up my develpment enronment.
the latter slowed me down for this project but should be a boost to my productivity the rest of the 
sememster. The last set back I had was that we hardly covered fork() in my 2750 so I had to catch up 
a bit.  I am taking 15hrs this semester so this is making me consider if I have the time to take OS 
this semester. I am hoping you will let me turn this in late, esp since the other OS class is two lectures
ahead and there project was extended. I will not be asking again in the sememster, only since it was the first
project and I needed some extra time to get back into C programming.

I turned in some garbage code wednesday night just to get something in before the deadline. it ened up shutting my
computer off when I ran it. I started over so all my git logs are different and dated after. This was becuase I wanted to organized my project differently and I didnt want to use Clions version controll, after I was able to set up
the embed terminal to run linux I did all my git control from there. This also let me gitignore the CMAKE files
